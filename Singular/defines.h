/**
* @brief Defines header
* This header defines more explicit names for access modifiers in order to increase readability.
* @remarks Details
* modifier_construct Used for constructors and destructors.
* modifier_methods Used for class methods.
* modifier_members Used for non data class members. E.g. general control variables.
* modifier_data_members Used for data class members. E.g. arrays, pointers to data, persistent data (static).
* modifier_enums Used for enumerators (structs should go to data_members).
* modifier_operators Used for operator overloading.
* @remarks
* We could further subdivide with static, const and other identifiers, but that would became confusing.
* Instead, logicaly divide then within the above defined blocks.
